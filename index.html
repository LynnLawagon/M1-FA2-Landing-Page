            <h2>What is FreshSense?</h2>
            <p>FreshSense is a compact, easy-to-use device that 
                continuously monitors the air in mushroom farms for 
                unusual odors indicating problems like mold or bacteria. 
                When it detects an issue, it instantly alerts the farmer’s 
                phone, allowing for quick action. Essentially, it serves as a 
                “nose that never sleeps,” protecting the harvest around the clock.

        <h2>Why Smell Matters in Mushroom Farming?</h2>
        <p>Most mushroom problems begin with subtle 
            odors that humans cannot detect, appearing 
            hours or days before visible signs like mold 
            or discoloration. Farmers often notice issues 
            too late, after contamination has spread. FreshSense 
            addresses this by detecting these early invisible smells, 
            giving farmers a head start to prevent damage and protect their harvest.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="info-section body1" id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How FreshSense Works</h2>
        <p>FreshSense is made up of two main parts:</p>
        
        <div class="feature-block">
            <p>
                1. A smart odor sense
                <br>
                This is the small device placed in mushroom growing rooms. It checks the air 
                for certain smells that are known to be early signs of trouble. It doesn’t need 
                water, sunlight, or complicated setup—just place it and turn it on
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-block">
            <p>
                2. A Mobile App for Farmers
                <br>
                The app shows what FreshSense is detecting. If the air is clean and healthy, 
                everything will appear green. If something unusual starts to happen, the app 
                changes color and sends a message like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>🌱“Warning: Possible mold activity in Room 2.”</li>
                <li>🌱“Alert: Air quality changing—check humidity or ventilation.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Farmers can then act quickly by adjusting temperature, cleaning a tray, 
                improving airflow, or removing infected spots.
                <br>
                Everything is designed to be easy to understand so any farmer, no matter 
                their background, can use it comfortably
            </p>

    <section class="info-section body4" id="simple-tool">
        <h2>A Simple Tool With a Big Impact</h2>
        <p>FreshSense brings a new way of thinking to farming. Instead of reacting only 
        when something looks wrong, FreshSense helps farmers act early—before the 
        damage spreads. The goal is simple: give every mushroom farm the chance to 
        run smoothly and successfully.

        <h2>What Makes FreshSense Different?</h2>
        <p>FreshSense is built specifically for mushroom farms. Traditional sensors only measure temperature and humidity. FreshSense goes beyond that by focusing on smell, the earliest sign of contamination.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Other tools detect problems late—FreshSense detects them early</p>
        <br>
        <p>This gives farmers time to react, save the harvest, and prevent bigger losses.</p>
